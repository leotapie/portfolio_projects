## Projects

My main focus for these projects has been to:
- learn about best practices associated with cleaning and maanipulating datasets
- utilise my Python, SQL and Tableau skills
- and showcase my knowledge of a wide range of plotting libraries and visualisation tools.

I've added a short description of each project below so you choose what you wish to look at.

## About Me

I'm French but have been living in England for the last 8 years (London based these days). I've had the chance to grow up in Poland, Czech Republic and France, and
come from a multi-cultural familly - that's probably why I love travelling and meeting people with different backgrounds! 

I'm a mechanical engineer by education - I studied in Leeds for 4 years. And system engineer by trade - I worked at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) for 3.5 years.
I worked in couple different teams during my time at JLR, but most relevantly worked on system integration for hybrid and future zero-carbon powertrains
(BEV and FCEV for those interested in the autimotive industry!). My interest in data modelling and analysis really began then, where I was responsible for
building a tool to draw insights from drive cycles test data. The tool's key outputs included structured report and an interactive interface that encapsulated
visualisation graphs. Unfortunately, I can't share any of this publicly but would be more than happy to chat about it if anyone out there is interested!
